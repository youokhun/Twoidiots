        <h2>Two idiots in love, made a travel blog</h2>
        <p>One very sunny afternoon, Janis invited Kevin to a house party. She loved cooking so she made dinner for
            everyone. Kevin arrived and made friends with everyone before even speaking to Janis. Later that night, he
            plucked up the courage and asked to kiss her. <br> <br> Today they live together in a 400 year old building
            filled with books and plants.</p>

            <p>My day-to-day includes digital marketing, graphic design and looking up cinematic stills and poems to
                send to Kevin. Before moving to London, I worked at large scale culinary events and luxury F&B outlets for their marketing.</p>
